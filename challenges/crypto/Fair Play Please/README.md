# Fair Play Please
I have chosen a very "fair" cipher for this challenge, and the keyword for this cipher is "CRYPTO". I hope you find the challenge as "fair" as I do.

Do remember to include the flag format YCEP24{} before submitting your flag. For example if "ThisIsASampleFlag" is the flag, the correct format should be YCEP24{This_Is_A_Sample_Flag}
