Solution: Playfair Cipher uses the key "CRYPTO" as it's first 6 characters of the grid. Then subsequently, the other characters such as B,D,E and so on. Each character should only be used once in the grid, and should not be repeated. The letter "J" will not be used in the grid for this challenge. "CRYPTOABDEFGHIKLMNQSUVWXZ" will be how to final grid looks like. Use a playfair decoder with the final grid to decrypt the encrypted text.
