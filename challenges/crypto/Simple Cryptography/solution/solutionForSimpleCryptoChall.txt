To solve the challenge, the player can use online tools such as https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher to decode the Caesar ciphers, then use https://www.base64decode.org/ to decode the base64 encode. They will then get the flag. 

As the text given is J2aCrTmaF3YOrUGk, they can either find the shift of the Caesar Cipher through trial and error or by buying a hint. The shift is 5. Then, they can decode it thrice. J2aCrTmaF3YOrUGk -> E2vXmOhvA3TJmPBf, E2vXmOhvA3TJmPBf -> Z2qShJcqV3OEhKWa, Z2qShJcqV3OEhKWa -> U2lNcExlQ3JZcFRv. Then, decode it through base64. U2lNcExlQ3JZcFRv -> SiMpLeCrYpTo.
