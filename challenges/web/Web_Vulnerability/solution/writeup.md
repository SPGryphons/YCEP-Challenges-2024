### PoC Writeup for Web_Vulnerability

### Files Provided
- All files are provided in the `dist` folder.

## Step 1: Reconnaissance - Explore the Web Application

1. **Explore the Website:**
   - Navigate to the web application provided by the challenge.
   - Identify the available functionalities and endpoints.

2. **Identify the Login Page:**
   - URL: `http://<target-ip>/login.php`
   - This page contains fields for `username` and `password`.

## Step 2: Login to the Web Application

1. **Use Provided Credentials in [/Web_Vulnerability/service/db/init.sql](/Web_Vulnerability/service/db/init.sql):**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

2. **Login:**
   - Go to `http://<target-ip>/login.php`.
   - Enter the provided credentials.
   - Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the upload page at `http://<target-ip>/upload.php`.

## Step 3: Exploit File Upload Vulnerability

1. **Inspect the File Upload Form:**
   - The form allows users to upload files to the server.
   - URL: `http://<target-ip>/upload.php`

2. **Prepare a PHP Reverse Shell:**
   - Visit [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/) and generate a PHP reverse shell.

3. **Upload the Reverse Shell:**
   - Save the reverse shell as `revshell.php`.
   - Use the upload form on `http://<target-ip>/upload.php` to upload the `revshell.php` file.

## Step 4: Gain Shell Access

1. **Set Up a Listener:**
   - On your local machine, set up a listener to catch the reverse shell connection.
   - Use `nc` (Netcat) or any other suitable tool:
     ```bash
     nc -lvnp <your-port>
     ```

2. **Trigger the Reverse Shell:**
   - Navigate to the uploaded shell to trigger it.
   - URL: `http://<target-ip>/uploads/revshell.php`

3. **Gain Access:**
   - Once the reverse shell is triggered, you should receive a connection on your listener.
   - You now have shell access to the web server.

## Step 5: Retrieve the Flag

1. **Navigate to the Flag Location:**
   - The flag is located in `/var/www/html`.
   - Use the shell access to navigate to the directory:
     ```bash
     cd /var/www/html
     ls
     ```

2. **Read the Flag:**
   - The flag file should be listed in the directory.
   - Use the `cat` command to read the flag:
     ```bash
     cat flag.txt
     ```
